My name is Nick, Tsai. Now I am a software engineer at [Fiiser](https://www.fiiser.com) in Taiwan, working on many kinds of areas. For example, Android driver, emulator, multimedia encoding and decoding, HTTP server, Dev ops and so on. For more, please refer to my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nick-hungi-tsai-a74699a2/).

Meanwhile, I still enjoy in any areas related to Computer Science. Recently, I have learned [Machine Learning(CS229)](http://cs229.stanford.edu/) and [Computer Vision(CS231n)](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) on Youtube. Now I start to challenge [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) competitions. Hope that I can get a nice grade there. I would also share some basic intuitions here for someone who would like to start competing on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com).

Last but not least, I start this blog for sharing and leaving records that can help me to find something I have done before. Hope that there is something that can let anyone saving some times. :)
